# Discontinued

Due to fact that I have provided two other devices that allow for bigger customization, i will not maintain this Quick App anymore.

Please choose https://github.com/ikubicki/fibaro-sma-power-sensor and https://github.com/ikubicki/fibaro-sma-energy-sensor instead.

# SMA Inverters integration plugin

Allows to pull few metrics from SMA inverter via API of the unit.
To authorize you need to provide API URL, API Password and optionally API User which defaults to usr.

This application provides values for:

- PV system power
- Current PV power
- PV energy produced today
- Total PV energy
